		<h2>What is Feldenkrais?</h2>
		<p>The Feldenkrais method is a somatic learning approach pioneered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosh%C3%A9_Feldenkrais">Mosh√© Feldenkrais</a>, 
			that focuses on gentleness, comfort, ease, and creativity.</p>

		<p>Teaching is done via two main modes &#8212; in <i>Awareness Through Movement</i>, the practioner uses his or her voice to guide
			students through gentle movements, and in <i>Functional Integration</i>, the practitioner works with one student hands-on, 
			to move the student's body in a shared exploration of the individual's own comfort and ease.</p>

		<p>The Feldenkrais method has found many applications in healing practices such as physical therapy and pain reduction, and
			is also widely enjoyed by performers and artists for its focus on ease of movement and spontaneity.</p>
